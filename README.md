## The request report
The teaching salary of a teacher invited for a semester at Thang Long University is the total amount of money for teaching classes in the semester, calculated as follows
Fee for teaching each class = number of periods * (teacher coefficient + subject coefficient + class coefficient) * teaching fee for a standard hour

The teacher coefficient is usually calculated according to the degree of the teacher, for example, a university graduate is 1.3, a master is 1.4, a doctor is 1.5, an associate professor is 1.6, a professor is 1.7.

The coefficient for the subject is usually 0, depending on the difficulty, it can be from 0.1 to 0.3
The class coefficient depends on the number of students, the number of students <20 class coefficient is -0.5, the class coefficient from 20 to 40 students is 0, the class coefficient from 40 students is 0.2

Write a program that calculates tuition fees for a semester for invited teachers. The program has the following functions:

1. Set a standard one-hour teaching fee (eg 100,000 VND)
2. Setting the coefficients of teachers according to qualifications
3. Enter teacher information (information such as full name, code, degree, ...)
4. Enter information about classes that teachers teach in a semester (information such as subjects, number of students, ..)
5. Calculate the teacher's fee for that period. Print out a table with columns: No., class, number of periods, tuition The last row is the total row. (The first part has information such as teacher code, teacher name)
